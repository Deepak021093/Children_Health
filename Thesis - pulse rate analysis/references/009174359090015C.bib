abstract = "Considerable evidence documents the aggregation of cardiovascular risk factors in children; yet, very little is known about the covariation of children's health practices. Accordingly, using a multivariate and developmental perspective, the present research examines the interrelationships among multiple health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, eating habits, smoking, alcohol use, and stress-related behaviors) in 1,092 predominantly low-socioeconomic status, rural schoolchildren (ages 11–18, grades 6–12). Our data provide support for a multidimensional view of children's health habits and suggest that patterns of interrelationships may vary at different developmental levels. Implications of these results are discussed and directions for future research are highlighted."
