Children's Health: Pulse Analysis

Aim:

	To analyse the pulse rates of children and identify the group of children with elevated pulse rates, so that early diagnosis of cardiac related problems can be made.

Analysis:

	The dataset consists of various fields in Longitudinal format, and it tracks details such as Pulse, BP, height, weight, etc for the same set of individuals, over a period of 12 years. Various possible analysis was performed, and the results have been provided in a report of pdf format (generated using R). 

There a two coding files used: The first one names "Exploratory analysis_final" provides basic analysis of the dataset, such as dealing with missing variables, relationship between variables, etc. The second one, named as "Clustering_final", provides the code for the clustering (grouping) of the children for unusually high pulse rates.
